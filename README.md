# Seq2Seq-Chatbot-using-Pytorch
This is a generative Chatbot build using the pytorch deep learning library.

This chatbot uses a Seq2Seq model which takes a sequence as input and generates another sequence as output.

The model uses GRU (Gated Recurrent Units) and LSTM (Long Short Term Memory) for traning and generation of sentences.

The model is trained on movie-corpus dataset

Requirements:
  1. pytorch latest version
  2. the data set in this link https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~cristian/Cornell_Movie-Dialogs_Corpus.html
